# RTv1

The first version of this raytracer project is a proof of concept on the theory of raytracing - ie. rendering 3D images,
and is based on the work of Jamis Buck from the book "The Raytracer Challenge".

The scenes are parsed from .json formatted files to create the images, using minilibx graphics library. 

Only 4 basic shapes are used to create the scenes - namely spheres, planes, cones and cylinders, however they can all be
transformed, scaled and rotated so prove quite versatile in creating fun images. 
There are a few additionalfeatures in this version, including multiple lights, cones and cylinders that can be cut, 
have lids/no lids as well as the shine effect, however the real fun can be seen 
in the follow up project which can be found in the RT repository.

Here are some screenshots from the project
